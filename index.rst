Contributing
------------

The `source for this documentation
<http://github.com/jaylett/xapian-docsprint>`_ is being kept on github; the
best way to contribute is to add issues, comments and pull requests there.
We're monitoring IRC during the sprint sessions (and in general) so you can
also contact us on channel #xapian on irc.freenode.net [`webchat link
<http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=%23xapian>`_].

Assuming you're on Debian or Ubuntu or another Debian-derived distro, you'll
need to install either the `python-sphinx` or `python3-sphinx` package in
order to be able to generate this documentation from a git checkout.  Once
you've done that, you can generate HTML output with `make html`.

Indices and tables
==================

.. we could enable an index later with: * :ref:`genindex`

* :ref:`search`

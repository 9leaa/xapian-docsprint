Don't commit or flush after every modification, unless you really need to. Modifications are much much faster if they're grouped together. If you must flush every modification immediately, consider using a small database of recent modifications, merged with a larger database of earlier modifications.

Don't put data into value slots which isn't going to be used during the search process. It's often tempting to do this to get an easy way to store fielded data, but storing extra data in the values will crowd some of the data required for searches out of the cache, producing a slower search. Use the document "data" slot for this.

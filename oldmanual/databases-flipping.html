<h1><a name="databases-flipping"></a>2.6 Flipping databases</h1>
<p>
It is often useful to update a database by building a new database containing an updated version of the data, and flipping from the old version to the new version, so that newly opened readers start picking up the new version of the database. This can be done to great effect, but there are several things to be aware of if you are performing searches in parallel with this change.
</p>
<p>
Obviously, deleting the old database and copying or moving a new database into place would leave a window of time in which any readers trying to open the database would find files missing, producing Xapian::DatabaseOpeningError errors. If you simply copy or replace the individual files, you may get even more subtle errors; Xapian will usually notice the discrepancy if some files from an old version of the database and some from a new version are present, but may not always do so, and may well raise Xapian::DatabaseCorruptError if it becomes confused.
</p>
<p>
There are actually very few filesystem operations which can be used to allow an "atomic" change to be made to a database. Fortunately, there is one such operation: moving a file to a new path, replacing any copies of the database at that path, is an atomic operation on almost all systems. [FIXME - check for details of any systems where it isn't.] All processes will either see the filesystem as it was before the move/replace, or as it was afterwards; there'll never be a partial modification visible.
</p>
<p>
The recommended approach for flipping database versions is to use a stub database to refer to the current version of the database. One approach is be to append a timestamp to the end of each newly created database, and then to create a stub database file pointing to the latest database. Once the newly created database is in place and ready to be used, the newly created stub database file can be moved to replace the old stub database file, taking advantage of the atomic nature of this operation to ensure that a reader would never see a partially flipped database.
</p>
<p>
On POSIX filesystems, the contents of an open file can be accessed even if the original file on disk has been unlinked. An open Xapian database maintains an open filehandle to all the files holding the database contents. This allows the old version of the database to be unlinked immediately after the stub database file has been updated, without fear that an open reader will be affected by this deletion.
</p>
<p>
On non POSIX filesystems (specifically, on Windows), an error will be raised by a reader if the files it was using are deleted before it completes. On such systems, you should either wait for all readers using the old version to close, or be prepared to catch errors due to the deletion.
</p>
<p>
Don't be tempted to use a symlink instead of a stub database to switch between database versions. Xapian doesn't resolve all symlinks on the path to a database before opening it, so if the symlink is changed while the database is being opened, a mixture of old and new files may be opened.

<h1><a name="databases-creating"></a>2.1 Creating and opening databases</h1>
<p>
Databases can be opened for reading only, or for reading and writing. A database reader is represented by a <code>Xapian::Database</code> object, and a database writer is represented by a <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code> object. Note that <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code> is a subclass of <code>Xapian::Database</code>, so it's possible to do all operations that it's possible to do on a <code>Xapian::Database</code> on a <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code>. For example, a search can be performed on a <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code>.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to <a name="i0"></a>create a new database is simply to call the <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code> constructor:
</p>
<pre><code>Xapian::WritableDatabase db("myfirstdb", Xapian::DB_CREATE);
</code></pre>
<p>
This will create a new database, using the default database format, at the path &#8216;myfirstdb&#8217; (relative to the current working directory). The <code>DB_CREATE</code> flag tells the constructor to create a new database: an exception will be raised if a database (or anything else) already exists at the specified path. Other available flags are:
</p>
<ul><li>
<code>DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN</code>: like <code>DB_CREATE</code>, but will simply open the database at the specified path if it already exists.
</li>
<li>
<code>DB_CREATE_OR_OVERWRITE</code>: like <code>DB_CREATE</code>, but will overwrite the database at the specfied path if it already exists.
</li>
<li>
<code>DB_OPEN</code>: the database will be opened if it already exists, but if it doesn't exist an exception will be raised.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To <a name="i1"></a>open a database for reading, use the <code>Xapian::Database</code> constructor:
</p>
<pre><code>Xapian::Database db_readonly("myfirstdb");
</code></pre>
<p>
This will open the database for reading only, and raise an exception if no database exists at the specified path.
</p>
<p>
There are various different formats of database; if you want a format other than the default format for some reason, there are special factory methods available to create such databases - see <a href="databases-backend-formats.html#databases-backend-formats">section 2.9</a> for details. The Xapian::Database constructor will automatically determine the format of the database at the path supplied and open it (assuming the format is recognised). Similarly, the Xapian::WritableDatabase constructors, when supplied with an existing database, and appropriate flags (ie, <code>Xapian::DB_OPEN</code> or <code>Xapian::DB_CREATE_OR_OPEN</code>) will also automatically determine the format and open it.
</p>
<p>
If you just want to get on with adding documents to a database, you can skip to the next chapter now. There are lots of things to be aware of about databases when building a production-ready system on top of Xapian, though, so come back and read the rest of this chapter later!
</p>
<h2><a name="databases-closing"></a>2.1.1 Closing</h2>
<p>
A writable database is closed automatically when both the <code>Xapian::WritableDatabase</code> object is deleted, and when any Xapian objects which are derived from the database object are closed. For example, if a <code>Xapian::PostingIterator</code> has been created from the database, the database will not be closed until that iterator is deleted as well as the database object. (See <a href="posting-iterators.html#posting-iterators">section 8.1</a> for more details on <code>Xapian::PostingIterator</code>).
</p>
<p>
This is very convenient in many situations - it means that it is not necessary to keep track of whether a database object has been deleted yet when using iterators or other objects derived from it. However, it can result in the database remaining open longer than expected, causing problems if you try and open the database for writing again before the database has been closed.
</p>
<p>
For this reason, databases support an explicit <code>close()</code> method. This can be called to close a database immediately, without waiting for all references to the database to be deleted. If an attempt is made to access the database after closing, it will usually result in a <code>Xapian::DatabaseError</code> exception being raised.

Let's write some code
---------------------

Here's some example code to implement this index plan.

.. literalinclude:: /code/python/index1.py

You can run this code to index a sample data file (called here
``100-objects-v1.csv``) to a database at path ``db`` as follows::

    python index1.py 100-objects-v1.csv db

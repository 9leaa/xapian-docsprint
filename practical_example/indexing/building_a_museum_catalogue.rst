Building a museum catalogue
===========================

We're going to build a simple search system based on museum catalogue data 
released under a Creative Commons license (By-NC-SA) by the Science Museum 
in London, UK.

http://api.sciencemuseum.org.uk/documentation/collections/

To make things easier, we've extracted just the first 100 objects and 
provide them as a gzipped CSV file, ``100-objects-v1.csv``.

Introduction
============

Xapian is an open source search engine library, which allows developers to 
add advanced indexing and search facilities to their own applications. 

This document aims to be a guide to getting up and running with your first 
database, explaining basic concepts and providing code examples of the 
library's core functionality.

If you just want to follow our code examples, you can skip the chapter on "Core
Concepts" and go straight to :ref:`a-practical-example` - but you should
probably make sure you have Xapian installed first!

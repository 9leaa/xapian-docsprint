Databases
=========

Pretty much all Xapian operations revolve around a Xapian _database_.  Before
performing a search, details of the documents being searched need to be put
into the database - the search process then refers to the database to determine
the best matches for a given query. The process of putting documents into the
database is usually referred to as indexing.

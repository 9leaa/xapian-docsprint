Facets
======

.. todo:: Write about how to get facets from a search.  Talk about storing
	  facets in slots, and the builtin matchspy classes for faceting.
	  Maybe talk about handling multiple facet values in a single slot.
	  Talk about bucketing for numeric facets.  Note; some of this stuff
	  isn't in trunk yet (bucketing + multiple values) - perhaps just note
	  that it's currently in development.

.. todo:: Start from facets.rst.

Query authorisation
===================

.. todo:: Write about how to limit results based on authorisation schemes.
	  Discuss filtering results coming back from a query, and the problems
	  with just doing that.  Discuss implementing auth schemes by indexing
	  appropriate data.  Discuss hybrid schemes (implementing auth using
	  indexed terms, and also filtering results).  Discuss issues relating
	  to updates (in particular, how fast does something need to be hidden
	  if it is changed to being private).

.. todo:: Check if there is existing documentation which can be used as a
          skeleton for this.

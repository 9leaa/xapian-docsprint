Sorting
=======

.. todo:: Write about how to do alternative sort orders.  In particular;
	  storing a value to sort by.  `sortable_serialise()` should be
	  mentioned again (but was earlier discussed in "range searches").
	  Discuss sorting by multiple values, and sorting by some values then
	  relevance.  Discuss sorting by relevance then values, with additional
	  discussion of why that's unlikely to be useful with current schemes
	  (because they rarely give the same weight to multiple documents).

.. todo:: Start from sorting.rst.

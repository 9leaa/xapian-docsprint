Range queries
=============

.. todo:: Write about how to do range queries.  Discuss how to index numeric
	  values using sortable_serialise(), and probably discuss how to index
	  dates as YYYYMMDD, too, since that's a common scheme.  Discuss
	  ValueRangeProcessor use with query parsers.  Maybe discuss
	  performance issues (ie, range searches can be slow because they have
	  to run through all potential matches) - lead on to a discussion of
	  speeding up range searches with terms covering parts of the range.

.. todo:: Check if there is existing documentation which can be used as a
          skeleton for this.
